# My dotfiles (finaalllyyyyy...)

These are dotfiles for some of my most important configurations.

All custom configurations are managed on a topical basis (i.e., all aliases and configurations for `python` can be found in `dotfiles/python`). I've also added support for **config files that are placed in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`** (usually ~/.config/appname/config.file).

## Acknowledgement

I forked [Zach Holman](http://github.com/holman)'s [dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and added the support for configuration files in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.
